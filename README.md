# Movie-Recomendation-Model-On-Auto-Encoder
Auto Encoder is one of the most popular Unsupervised Learning in Deep Learning
This is a directed type of neural network, everything move from left to right
The popose of auto encoder is to encode itself, it take some sort of inputs put some trough error through hidding layer and then gets output by it aims for the outputs to be identicle to input that is how auto encoder going to be training to set them up to  such a way that on the output you get values which are equaulent to your inputs so auto encoder is not a pure type of unsoperwised Deeo Learning Algorithm, they are actually a self superwised Deep Learning algorith because they are compareing ont the end.
So it's used for Feature Detection, Recommendation System and For Encoding Data.
